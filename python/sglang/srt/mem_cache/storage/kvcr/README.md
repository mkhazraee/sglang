# KVCR direct linker

The KVCR linker transfers registered GPU KV pages directly to and from KVCR's
local DRAM or a hinted remote KVCR peer. It uses `deposit`, `query`, and `deliver`,
with at most four layer deliveries outstanding. Its owner thread continuously
polls KVCR, including while idle, so peer requests and transfer lifecycle events
keep progressing. Framework source-pin requests are declined; peers can retrieve
completed deposits in KVCR-owned DRAM.

## Setup

Install KVCR with its NIXL/UCX dependencies in the serving environment. Use the
public API from KVCR revision `8a91e20` or a compatible revision that includes
the local-copy timeout lifecycle fix.

DRAM additions and removals carry `ownership="kvcr"` in the existing KV event
stream. Engine GPU events and cache clears retain the default ownership. Dynamo
needs its ownership-aware, versioned state-agent ingress to consume these events;
the legacy ingress rejects KVCR ownership. In-process DRAM does not survive engine
loss or runtime reset, but its inventory shares the retained cache-owner lifetime.
Ownership is not a durability claim.

## Worker configuration

An example worker configuration is:

```bash
python -m sglang.launch_server \
  --model-path zai-org/GLM-5.2-FP8 \
  --trust-remote-code --tp-size 8 --page-size 64 \
  --enable-unified-cache-external-linker \
  --unified-cache-external-linker-backend kvcr \
  --hicache-storage-backend-extra-config '{
    "dram_size_gb": 8,
    "control_host": "0.0.0.0",
    "advertise_host": "192.0.2.10",
    "control_port": 19500,
    "nixl_port": 20500,
    "operation_timeout_ms": 1000,
    "abandon_timeout_ms": 5000
  }'
```

Replace `192.0.2.10` with an address reachable by the other workers. These options
are strict; unknown names fail startup.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kvcr_service_socket_path` | `/run/kvcr/memory.sock` | Guard service socket; `null` explicitly selects in-process DRAM. |
| `guard_index` | `0` | Base Guard index; the global rank is added. |
| `compatibility_digest` | Model/layout/shard namespace | Must match the Guard service's deployment compatibility digest. |
| `dram_size_gb` | `1` | Fallback in-process DRAM GiB per rank, rounded down to complete pages across all pools. |
| `control_host` | `0.0.0.0` | Address on which KVCR binds peer control. |
| `advertise_host` | Resolved local hostname | Address peers use to reach this worker. |
| `control_port` | `19500` | Base control port; the global rank is added. |
| `nixl_port` | `20500` | Base NIXL port; the global rank is added. |
| `operation_timeout_ms` | `1000` | Positive operation deadline in milliseconds. |
| `abandon_timeout_ms` | `5000` | Failure-reporting deadline, at least twice the operation timeout. |

## Guard memory and fallback

Workers first claim Guard-backed memory through KVCR's public API. A missing
socket or refused connection falls back to anonymous DRAM inside the serving
process. An incompatible/busy Guard, permission error, or interrupted claim
fails startup: these do not prove that falling back is safe. KVCR owns Guard
claiming, recovery, and release; SGLang does not allocate a second DRAM pool
when a claim succeeds.

Provision the service using KVCR's `python -m kvcr.kvcr_service` command with
`--socket-path`, `--pool-dir`, `--guard-count`, `--pool-sizes-gb`, and
`--compatibility-digest`. Startup logs include the requested digest and ordered
pool layouts (name and block bytes). The service's ordered pool capacities, not
`dram_size_gb`, size Guard memory. Allocate a distinct Guard index per worker;
reserve separate index ranges and ports for colocated replicas. A service has
one digest across its Guards. For nonreplicated TP shards, set the same explicit
deployment digest on the service and all workers; change it when the model,
dtype, layout, page size, or parallel topology changes. Storage keys still retain
their individual shard namespaces.

In fallback mode, each pool receives capacity proportional to its bytes per
physical page, giving all pools the same page capacity. Set
`"kvcr_service_socket_path": null` to select this mode explicitly.

## Operational constraints

DRAM and GPU registrations remain owned until successful KVCR shutdown. A
shutdown error retains the mappings; an uncertain transfer keeps its affected
GPU pages unavailable for reuse until quiescence is established.

As with other external Linkers, `flush_cache` drains transfers but does not
clear Guard storage. Recovered KV is valid only for unchanged model weights and
layout. Online weight replacement requires a fresh model/cache identity or
restarting with cleared storage and matching peers; flush alone is insufficient.

Remote hints use KVCR's versioned `kv.fetch` envelope, with a reachable
`source_control_endpoint` and uint64 `block_hashes`. Hints are advisory. The
lookup does not reserve source storage: capacity eviction between lookup and
delivery is an admitted load failure, including eviction caused by an older
offload. Failed admitted loads follow Linker's error path, without automatic
recomputation. Unsupported hint actions are ignored with a warning. The
runtime maps a storage hash's first 16 hexadecimal digits to the router hash.
With `cache_salt` or `extra_key`, existing KV events use a different hash chain;
those event hashes do not produce remote hits unless the router supplies the
corresponding storage hashes. Hints must target the matching source shard. The
adapter does not rewrite hint endpoints, so remote hints are disabled for layouts
requiring shard-specific routing. Local reuse remains enabled.

## Manual checks and profiling

Install model weights and the normal SGLang test dependencies alongside the
KVCR/NIXL/UCX prerequisites above. Run the manual acceptance harness from the
repository root; `--model-path` accepts a local checkpoint:

```bash
python test/manual/cache/test_kvcr_linker.py --model glm52 --case local
python test/manual/cache/test_kvcr_linker.py --model glm52 --case peer --profile
```

This example uses TP8. Peer checks need two disjoint groups of eight visible GPUs
on one host and, when using Guard, at least 16 Guards. Reserve control ports
19500..19507 / 19600..19607 and NIXL ports 20500..20507 / 20600..20607.
Start with fresh Guard pools for both replicas, especially the destination, so an
old local copy cannot masquerade as peer delivery. Use a new `--pool-dir` when
provisioning the Guard service for these checks.

Local cases require host-tier hits and compare cached decode logprobs with cold
prefill. Peer cases also compare greedy tokens with a cold source baseline,
with no inference requests to the source during peer checks.

`--output-dir` retains server logs, optional CPU/GPU profiles, and
`runtime_versions.json` with the installed KVCR version/source and available
repository commits/worktree changes. For profiling, align per-batch debug logs
(per-layer readiness, total batch drain time, and CPU `deliver()` submission time)
with the `--profile` GPU transfer and transformer-kernel timeline. Record the
overlap interval and bytes transferred; CPU readiness times and overlapping HTTP
requests alone cannot prove DMA/compute overlap. Use a system GPU trace if the
PyTorch profile does not expose NIXL transfers. The harness asserts neither
throughput nor overlap.

Run unit tests in separate processes, as CI does:

```bash
python -m pytest test/registered/unit/mem_cache/test_unified_cache_linker.py -q
python -m pytest test/registered/unit/mem_cache/test_linker_pool_assembler.py -q
python -m pytest test/registered/unit/mem_cache/test_kvcr_direct_linker.py -q
python -m pytest test/registered/unit/mem_cache/test_registry.py -q
```
